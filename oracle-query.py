The test is failing because the issue links in the test data don't have the complete data structure that the _get_parent method is checking for. The method checks if the issue key starts with the same project prefix using:

```python
d['inwardIssue']['key'].startswith(self.data['key'].split('-')[0])
```

Let's fix the test data to properly match the project key pattern:

```python
def test_get_parent_multiple_links(self):
    """Test _get_parent with multiple parent links"""
    # Set the task key first
    self.base_fields['key'] = 'TEST-123'
    # Set up multiple links with matching project prefix (TEST-)
    self.base_fields['fields']['issuelinks'] = [
        {
            'type': {'inward': 'is child task of'},
            'inwardIssue': {
                'key': 'TEST-124',  # Same TEST prefix as task key
                'fields': {'project': {'key': 'TEST'}}
            }
        },
        {
            'type': {'inward': 'is child task of'},
            'inwardIssue': {
                'key': 'TEST-125',  # Same TEST prefix as task key
                'fields': {'project': {'key': 'TEST'}}
            }
        }
    ]
    
    mock_task = Mock()
    mock_task.parent = None

    with patch('jira_integration.models.Story.objects.get') as mock_get:
        mock_get.side_effect = Story.DoesNotExist()
        with self.assertRaises(ValueError) as context:
            self.parser._get_parent()
        
        self.assertEqual(
            str(context.exception),
            "Tasks cannot have multiple parents in the same project"
        )
```

The key changes:
1. Set the task key to 'TEST-123'
2. Make sure parent issue keys start with 'TEST-' to match the task's project
3. Add the full issue link structure including the project fields

This should now properly trigger the ValueError because:
1. The issue links are in the same project (both start with 'TEST-')
2. There are multiple valid parent links
3. The existing task check fails (Story.DoesNotExist)

The original test wasn't raising the ValueError because the issue links weren't being counted as valid parent links since they didn't match the project prefix check in `_get_parent()`. With these changes, the test should now pass.
