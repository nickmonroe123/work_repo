This behavior suggests that the code is hanging or encountering an issue during the `Story.objects.update_or_create()` operation. Since you see "hi1" but not "hi2", the operation is starting but not completing. This often happens with Django database operations when there's a deadlock, lock timeout, or another database concurrency issue.

Let's modify the code to add more detailed debugging and timeout handling:

```python
def create_or_update(self, story_data: Dict):
    """Create or update Story records."""
    from django.db import Error as DBError
    from django.db.utils import OperationalError
    from django.db import transaction
    import time

    print("hi1")

    try:
        # Remove epic_key from defaults since it's not a model field
        epic_key = story_data.pop('parent', None)

        print(f"Processing story {story_data['id']} with epic_key {epic_key}")

        # First, try to find the parent epic
        parent_epic = None
        if epic_key:
            try:
                parent_epic = Epic.objects.get(id=epic_key)
                print(f"Found parent epic {epic_key}")
            except Epic.DoesNotExist:
                print(f"Parent Epic {epic_key} not found for Story {story_data['id']}")

        # Prepare the defaults
        defaults = story_data.copy()
        if parent_epic:
            defaults['parent'] = parent_epic

        print(f"Attempting to update/create story with defaults: {defaults}")

        # Set a timeout for the transaction
        with transaction.atomic(using='default', savepoint=False):
            print("Starting update_or_create operation...")
            
            # Try to get existing story first
            try:
                story = Story.objects.select_for_update(nowait=True).get(id=story_data['id'])
                print("Found existing story, updating...")
                for key, value in defaults.items():
                    setattr(story, key, value)
                story.save()
                created = False
            except Story.DoesNotExist:
                print("Story doesn't exist, creating new one...")
                story = Story.objects.create(**defaults)
                created = True
            except OperationalError as e:
                print(f"Lock acquisition failed: {str(e)}")
                raise

            print("hi2")

            action = "Created" if created else "Updated"
            print(f"{action} story {story.id} successfully")

            return story

    except DBError as e:
        print(f"Database error while processing story {story_data['id']}: {str(e)}")
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Unexpected error while processing story {story_data['id']}: {str(e)} ({type(e).__name__})")
        raise
```

This modified version:

1. Uses `select_for_update(nowait=True)` to explicitly handle locking
2. Splits the update_or_create into separate get/create operations for better debugging
3. Adds more debug print statements
4. Wraps the operation in an explicit transaction
5. Includes the exception type in the error message

Could you try this version and let me know what output you get? Also, it would be helpful to know:

1. Are you using PostgreSQL, MySQL, or another database?
2. Are there any other processes that might be accessing the same records?
3. Does this happen consistently or intermittently?
4. Are there any relevant errors in your database logs?
